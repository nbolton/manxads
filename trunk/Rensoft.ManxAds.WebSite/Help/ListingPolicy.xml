    <Section Title="Category Spamming">
      <Paragraph>
        What is Category Spamming? Simply, when a user adds a listing to a category that is not
        relevant, this is generally considered category spamming. Usually category spammers will
        add their listing to several categories in order to recieve maximum exposure, but this comes
        at the cost to other uses, since it's reduces the quality of categories on ManxAds.

    <Section Title="Scammers">
      <Paragraph>
        What are Scammers? A scammer is a person who posts a listing with the intent to recieve money
        off a user, with no intention to provide goods or services in return (and vice versa). This 
        behaviour is highly illegal, and any scams will always be immediately reported to the Isle 
        of Man Police Department by ManxAds, with no exceptions!
